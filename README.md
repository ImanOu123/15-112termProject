Bugs to Watch Out For:

1. The TTS doesn't stop when a new TTS is activated, therefore, before clicking anywhere new or pressing a new button, wait for the TTS to stop speaking.
2. If you have any issues with the screen reader, wait for all speaking to be complete and press Alt 
3. There is sometimes an issue with pressing buttons in the instruction section, therefore, after you press the key once, wait a few seconds and if it doesn't speak, press the button again. It should be a pretty quick as there are no unefficient algorithms in that section. But definetly do wait just in case, to avoid an overlap of TTS.
